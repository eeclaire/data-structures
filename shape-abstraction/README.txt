CIS 2168 - Data Structures (Assignment 3)



Given a set of points in a textfile, read and add each point to a linked list, and display the original deer using Dr. Lakaemper's SimpleGUI interface. As the user moves the slider down, calculate the significance value of each point in the list and eliminate the least significant points to abstract down the shape.

It was given that 38 points is the minimum number of points with which the shape could be drawn for the user to recognize the deer shape.



Project realized in Java using NetBeans.
