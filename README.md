# Data Structures

A collection of projects related to data structure concepts 

*Note*: Several of these projects previously existed in their own individual repos before they were all pulled into this one for the sake of succinctness.

=========

## Projects:
#### In Java :mortar_board:
* [Hashtable Visualization](./hashtable-visualization) - Visualize how a hashtable works 
* [Heap Heap Hoorah](./heap-heap-hoorah) - Visualize how a heap works
* [Image Pizelization](./image-pixelization) - Pixelize an image using block width controlled with a GUI slider
* [Linked List Visualization](./linked-list-visualization) - Visualize how a linked list works
* [Maze](./maze) - Find the path out of a maze using recursion and linked lists
* [Quadratic Tree](./quad-tree) - Randomly generate a quadratic tree
* [Shape Abstraction](./shape-abstraction) - Abstract down a shape by finding the most visually-significant points in a linked list

#### In Python :snake:
* [Bloom Filter](./bloom-filter) - Check whether an element is definitely not, or probably in a set using a Bloom filter
* [Markov Chain](./markov-chain) - Generate sentences using a Markov Chain built using text of your choice
* [Prim's Algorithm](./prims) - Find the MST in a graph using Prim's algorithm
* [Unrolled Linked List](./unrolled-linked-list) - A linked list combined with arrays
* [Weight Balanced Tree](./weight-balanced-tree) - A self balancing tree that uses the size of each subtree
